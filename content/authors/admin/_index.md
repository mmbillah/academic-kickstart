I am a 2nd year PhD Candidate in the School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering and alongside pursuing a Masters in Statistics at Washington State University, Pullman. My current research is on developing numerical models for biophysical systems and performing stochastic simulations based on C++ and Fortran programming language.

I am a self motivated learner and a data science enthusiast.
