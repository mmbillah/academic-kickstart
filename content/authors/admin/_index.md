Welcome to my personal website which serves to showcase my portfolio. I am currently a PhD Candidate in the School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering (MME) at Washington State University (WSU), Pullman. I completed my Master's Degree in Statistics from WSU in Fall 2022. I am actively looking for full time positions in Data Science, Machine Learning or similar roles.

My PhD research has been primarily focused on implementing a complex numerical model in C++ and Fortran programming language and performing stochastic (Monte Carlo) simulations for investigating drug delivery via blood-brain barrier (BBB). Lately, I have been working on utilizing Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving inverse heat treansfer problems. I am also studying complex polymer/solvent/nonsolvent systems for industrial applications using atomistic models and molecular dynamics simulations.

Pursuing MS in Statistics has fueled my interest in exploring the expansive world of machine learning and data science to decipher intriguing, real-life problems.
