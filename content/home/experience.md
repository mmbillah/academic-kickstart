Current research is focused on the following.

* Used finite volume method (FVM) for solving an inverse heat transfer problem using Bayesian Inference machine learning technique.

* Customized loss functions to deploy physics informed neural networks for complex unsteady, multi-dimensional heat transfer problems.

* Developed and further improved a probabilistic model based on Monte Carlo method written in C++ and Fortran programming language.

* Utilized the stochastic model for studying key parameters for drug delivery through blood brain barrier (BBB) as an aid for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

* Studied design parameters and relevant characteristic properties for manufacturing functional nanoparticle for drug delivery.

* Investigated complex polymer/solvent/nonsolvent systems for industrial applications using atomistic models and molecular dynamics simulations.

Worked remotely and had an enriching experience of learning new tools and techniques, summarized below.
  
* Worked within Agile software development environment by utilizing CI/CD tools and best practices.

* Incorporated new NLP functionalities (text summarization and emotion detection) to the existing codebase and wrote necessary code for unit testing and model benchmarking against relevant metrics.

* Contributed towards building a REST API (with FastAPI) having different NLP endpoints hosted by multiple AWS services such as S3, ECR, Lambda and API Gateway (using Pulumi IAC). Tested the endpoints in Postman and deployed to dev using Octopus Deploy.

* Worked on several other ongoing projects in the Data Science team to facilitate easier implementation by other organizations across the company. In the process, acquired hands on experience with Docker, Spark clusters in Databricks notebooks, Azure services such as DataLake, DevOps and ADF.
